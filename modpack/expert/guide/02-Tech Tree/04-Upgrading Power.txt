§2§lUpgrading Power

At this point, you may be feeling the need for more POWER!
There are many more options open to you at this point, but the Immersive Engineering options may be the easiest.

For the water wheel you will need a good amount of treated wood, and some IC2 machines to make the parts for the wheel.

You can connect the water wheels to a kinetic dynamo to generate power.

Let take a look at the changes to the recipes in Evolved.

And an example setup:

You could also go with a wind power setup, or perhaps some IC2 power.

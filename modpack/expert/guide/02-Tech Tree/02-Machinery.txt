§2§lFirst Machines

Power taken care of, the next step is to make the needed machines to make higher-tier ones. You'll note that Thermal Expansion and Ender IO machines need a few new things to produce.

The Forestry carpenter and thermionic fabricator are your first machines you'll need. These take standard RF.

Note Gold chest requires plates from IC2:

Once you get those built and powered, get your assembly table and lasers going. The more lasers you have, the shorter assembly time will be. 6 is a good start. Standard RF to these, too.

That done, you'll want a Railcraft rock crusher. Crushed obsidian is found in several recipes, but it can also crush ore. RF power source for this as well.

After this setup is complete, you can start looking at IC2 machines.

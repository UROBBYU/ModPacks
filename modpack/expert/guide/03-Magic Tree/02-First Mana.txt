§2§lYour first Mana

Botania is where the magic adventure kicks off.  So gather a few Botania flowers and make the petal apothecary.
It may be worth the time to get the Agricraft versions of the Botania flowers, but that is not required.

Apothecary:

Then make your pure daisies,  if you still need a bucket to get water into it see getting the bucket.

From here it is fairly basic progression as normal start of Botania, but here is is for reference:

Diluted Mana pool:

Then some basic generating flora:

Then a regular mana pool:

Once you have that initial setup, then we would want to increase that mana generation with some endoflames:

Then you can start producing your mana items (pearls/steel/glass) which you will need for many other magic recipes.

Note: Manasteel can be made from either steel or iron, however iron is double the mana cost:

Now you have the basics you will need to start the magic adventure!
